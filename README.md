Problem Statement
Access to financial resources is a significant challenge for farmers in Africa, which hinders their ability to expand their agricultural activities, maximize their agricultural potential, enhance productivity, and improve their livelihoods.Which increases the rates of poverty and hunger in Africa. Additionally, traditional investment opportunities often lack transparency and accessibility, limiting investors' ability to diversify their portfolios and invest in the agricultural sector. 
This disconnect between investors and farmers creates barriers to sustainable agricultural development, economic growth and makes poverty and hunger worse in Africa.
